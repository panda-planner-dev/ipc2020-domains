The following statistics are being generated by PANDA-PI (see: panda.hierarchical-task.net).
More specifically, it's produced by the output of the progression-based planner once it starts attempting to solve the problem.
(That's why only the first problems show solution costs, because the statistics were done by calling the planner without any
special configuration, and stopped directly afterwards.)
